Animal Image Classification using ResNet50
This project focuses on classifying different species of animals using deep learning techniques. We leverage the ResNet50 architecture, a 50-layer deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, and fine-tuned for our animal classification task.

Features
Deep Learning Architecture: Utilizes the powerful ResNet50 model, known for its residual learning framework, which helps in training deep networks by solving the vanishing gradient problem.
Transfer Learning: The ResNet50 model is pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on a custom animal image dataset to enhance the classification performance.
Multi-class Classification: The model is designed to classify several animal species with high accuracy.
Data Augmentation: Techniques such as flipping, rotation, and scaling are used to improve the model's generalization ability.
Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images of various animal species. Preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation are performed to ensure optimal training conditions.
